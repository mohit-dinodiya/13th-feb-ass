In order for our custom exception to have the same behavior as other exceptions in Python, we need to make sure that it inherits from the Exception class.\n",

    "Here are some best practices for exception handling in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "Be specific: Catch only the exceptions you need to catch and avoid using a catch-all except statement. This will help you write more precise error handling code that can distinguish between different types of exceptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Handle exceptions gracefully: When an exception occurs, handle it gracefully and provide helpful error messages to users. Avoid letting exceptions crash your program or reveal sensitive information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use finally blocks: Use finally blocks to execute cleanup code that must be run whether an exception occurred or not. This is especially useful when you need to release resources like file handles or network connections.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reraise exceptions: When you catch an exception, consider reraising it if you cannot handle it in your current context. This will allow the exception to propagate up the call stack and be handled by higher-level code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Don't ignore exceptions: Do not ignore exceptions or leave them unhandled. Ignoring exceptions can cause unexpected behavior or leave security vulnerabilities in your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use context managers: Use context managers like with statements to ensure that resources are properly acquired and released. This can help you avoid common errors like forgetting to close file handles.\n",
    "\n",
    "Log exceptions: Use logging to record exceptions and other errors. This can help you debug your code and identify problems more quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "By following these best practices, you can write more robust, maintainable, and secure code that can handle errors gracefully and provide a better user experience."
